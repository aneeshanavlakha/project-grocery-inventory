## Grocery Inventory

**What will the application do?** <br>
This application will keep inventory of groceries at home.<br>
It lets you track the *name* and *quantity* of groceries you use every day to 
see an *updated count* of which and how many of each you have left. <br>

Possible features include: 
* Setting alerts for low groceries
* Setting the desired or minimum amount of each grocery per week
* Adding new groceries
* Organizing groceries into categories e.g, Dairy, Dry Items, Fruits, Vegetables, Proteins etc.
* Tracking which grocery has gone bad instead of been used up
* Seeing a chart of each grocery's usage frequency, frequency of going bad etc.

X: Grocery (with name and quantity) <br>
Y: List of groceries divided into sub-categories (with current quantity
and alerts for the ones that are running low)

**Who will use it?**<br>
It can be used by anyone who keeps groceries in their home.

**Why is this project of interest to me?** <br>
As a student that lives alone, I am in charge of keeping tab on my groceries 
and eating habits i.e., what groceries I consume the most, least and how often.
I often find myself lost on which groceries I have left and how many. 
I think that this application will help me keep tabs on my food and also allow
me to keep tabs on my eating habits in order to maintain a healthy diet and 
plan for each end-of-week grocery haul.
