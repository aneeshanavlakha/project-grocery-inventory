# My Personal Project: Grocery Inventory

## Project Description

**What will the application do?** <br>
This application will keep inventory of groceries you have at home.<br>
It lets you track the *name* and *quantity* of groceries you use every day to 
see an *updated count* of which and how many of each you have left. <br>

Possible features include: 
- Setting alerts for low groceries 
- Setting the desired or minimum amount of each grocery per week 
- Adding new groceries 
- Organizing groceries into categories e.g, Dairy, Dry Items, Fruits, Vegetables, Proteins etc. 
- Tracking which grocery has gone bad instead of been used up 
- Seeing a chart of each grocery's usage frequency, frequency of going bad etc.

X: Grocery (with name and quantity) <br>
Y: List of groceries divided into sub-categories (with current quantity
and alerts for the ones that are running low)

**Who will use it?**<br>
It can be used by anyone who keeps groceries in their home.

**Why is this project of interest to me?** <br>
As a student that lives alone, I am in charge of keeping tab on my groceries 
and eating habits i.e., what groceries I consume the most, least and how often.
I often find myself lost on which groceries I have left and how many. 
I think that this application will help me, and others in my situation, 
keep tabs on our food and also allow us to keep tabs on our eating habits 
in order to maintain a healthy diet and plan for each end-of-week grocery haul.
